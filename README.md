## 📖 Overview

Conventional navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze) optimize for **time** and **distance**. They often route drivers through hazardous blackspots, narrow lanes, or unlit roads just to save a few seconds.

**SafeRoute AI** represents a paradigm shift in routing logic. By fusing satellite imagery, geometric vector analysis (road curvature), and real-time environmental data, we calculate a **Probabilistic Safety Score (0-100)** for every route. We don't just tell you the fastest way; we tell you the safest way.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 1. Geometric Risk Analysis
* Uses **OSMnx & NetworkX** to download real-world road networks.
* Calculates **Road Curvature** using vector math to identify sharp, dangerous turns.
* Detects infrastructure risks like **Narrow Roads**, **Poor Lighting**, and **High-Speed Zones**.

### 🤖 2. SafeBot (AI Assistant)
* Integrated **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite** LLM.
* Provides real-time advice on road safety, first aid protocols, and route details.
* **Smart Fallback System:** Automatically switches to an internal rule-based mode if the internet connection is unstable.

### 🌍 3. Live Environmental Data
* **Real-time AQI (Air Quality Index):** Fetched via Open-Meteo API to warn drivers of low visibility due to smog/pollution.
* **Weather Integration:** Live temperature and condition monitoring.

### 🆘 4. Emergency & Utility Suite
* **SOS Panic Button:** One-click access to National Emergency (112), Police (100), and Ambulance (102).
* **Simulated Computer Vision:** Analyzes road surface quality (Simulated for cloud optimization).
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Aesthetic UI with Glassmorphism design.

## ⚙️ Architecture & Optimization
Running complex AI and Graph computations on a free cloud tier (512MB RAM) required significant engineering optimization:

1.  **Dynamic Radius Calculation:** The backend calculates the exact distance between points and only downloads the specific map chunk needed (clamped to 2.5km) to prevent OOM (Out of Memory) crashes.
2.  **Lazy Loading:** Heavy libraries like `cv2` (OpenCV) are only imported into memory when specifically requested.
3.  **Garbage Collection:** Aggressive Python `gc.collect()` calls ensure memory is freed immediately after route generation.
